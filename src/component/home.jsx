              <p>
              My name is Nabil Sutjipto, and I am a Software Engineer based in Seattle, WA. Iâ€™m passionate in travel and exploration, which is the reason I am currently with Expedia, helping travelers like myself stay at ease by building solutions to help answer the uncertainty of travel. My areas of exploration goes beyond physical location as I also translate it to my engineering experience; to date I have built solutions for product personalization based on preference, connecting communities through the web, build on technologies to help talented people be found and working on open source projects.  I am currently developing in React.js, Node.js and Phyton.
              </p>

              <p>
              I truly believe that my passion has led me to where I am today; connecting with different individuals as I travel has helped me learn new ways to solve problems and even given me ideas on what to build next. As I document my journey through video and photography, the learnings and challenges i set forth to myself ensure that I will never stop learning.
